# FCC 25 + 5 Clock

A Pomodoro timer, which can be adjusted to suit one's needs. Made using jQuery.

The default Session and Break lengths are 25 and 5 minutes respectively, but can be changed to any number of minutes between 1 and 60 inclusive.

Once a Session finishes, the Break timer will automatically start, and vice versa.

Pressing 'RESET' will reset the timer and restore the default Session and Break lengths.
